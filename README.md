Research for [Pixel 4a Battery Performance Program](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Pixel_4a_Battery_Performance_Program)

## Summary

Google recently updated the Pixel 4a. The new update (`TQ3A.230805.001.S2`) drastically reduces battery life.

I tried to do some research to determine what was done but only made little progress.

However, someone who works closely with the Linux kernel did an analysis: https://social.treehouse.systems/@marcan/113914172433692339

#### What was changed?

According to https://social.treehouse.systems/@marcan/113914172433692339 :

Certain batteries seem to have been identified by Google as being defective. These batteries:

- Have had capacity reduced by half (from 3080 mAh to 1539 mAh)
- Have had charging voltage reduced from 4.44 volts to 3.95 volts
- Are now marked as "dead" by the kernel

#### Determine if battery is impacted by the new update

1. Install adb and follow the instructions to enable adb debugging on your phone: https://developer.android.com/tools/adb

2. Run this command:

   ```
   adb shell cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/serial_number
   ```

If your serial number contains this string, it will be impacted by the battery performance update:

```
8230020501
```

If your serial number contains this string, your battery is unaffected:

```
8230015901
```

## My research

- Date of change corresponds very closely with build date of latest image (`Thu Nov 14 10:07:56 UTC 2024`)
- What is `http://pa`? Some kind of internal Google link?
- `s5_chg_profile`: Charge profile? What is S5?
  - Getting my battery serial number with `adb shell cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/serial_number`, characters 26-27 are `S5`. Is this how problematic batteries are being identified?

#### Comparing changes to binary kernel

1. Setup

   ```
   git checkout android-13.0.0_r83
   lz4 -d Image.lz4 Image-s1
   git checkout android-13.0.0_r84
   lz4 -d Image.lz4 Image-s2
   ```

1. Diff

   ```
   $ diff <(strings Image-s1 | egrep -i 'battery|charger|chg.profile' | sort) <(strings Image-s2 | egrep -i 'battery|charger|chg.profile' | sort) | egrep '^<|^>'
   > 3google_battery: cannot register power supply notifer, ret=%d
   > 3google_charger: Cannot register power supply notifer, ret=%d
   > 6google_battery: time to full not available
   > 6google_battery: update debug_chg_profile:%d -> %d
   > 6google_charger: MSC_RESET: charge full in unexpected soc.
   > chg_profile_switch
   > google_debug_chg_profile
   > google,enable-switch-chg-profile
   ```

   ðŸ‘‰ It seems these strings have been added to the s2 image but aren't in the kernel source
